# Sentinel-X Forensic Intelligence Protocol

This document outlines the forensic analysis models and kernel-level integrity checks implemented in the Sentinel-X system.

## Forensic Data Models

### IP Geolocation Correlation
We correlate transaction origins with known IP reputation databases and perform distance-time calculations to detect 'Impossible Travel'.

### Behavioral Biometric Signatures
Signatures are generated based on mouse entropy, keystroke cadence, and cognitive load indices.

### Temporal Anomaly Detection
Detects transactions occurring outside of established business hours or historical usage patterns.
- **Signal**: Local hour analysis against expected range.
- **Risk Impact**: Medium (adds weight to risk score if detected).

## Risk Scoring Engine
The risk scoring engine incorporates:
- **Velocity Metrics**: Z-score analysis of transaction frequency.
- **Fingerprint Entropy**: Measuring the uniqueness of the device signature.
- **Kernel Integrity**: Attestation of memory pages and secure boot state.
